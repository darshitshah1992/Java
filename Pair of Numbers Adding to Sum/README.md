#Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Sample Run
array = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Sample Output:
[0, 1]

#Couple of solution has been implemented with Time Complexity of O(n^2) and O(n)

#How to compile and run the program
1. Download the java file
2. Change the test case if required for different problem
3. Execute via command line or IDE
4. Verify the output
